# NaMaster

NaMaster is a C library, Python module and standalone program to compute full-sky angular
cross-power spectra of masked, spin-0 and spin-2 fields with an arbitrary number of known
contaminants using a pseudo-CL (aka MASTER) approach.

See http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105302 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03577 for further details.

The following sources of documentation are available for users:
* [Scientific documentation](doc/doc_scientific.pdf): description of the methods implemented in NaMaster
* [C API documentation](doc/doc_C_API.pdf): description of the C library functionality and the NaMaster executable. Installation instructions and a description of all dependencies can also be found here.
* [Python wrapper documentation](doc/build/html/index.html): description of the python wrapper functionality and example code (go to http://htmlpreview.github.io/ to render these html pages).
* For the Python wrapper, the examples are also available via these [notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/daniellenz/NaMaster/tree/master/notebooks/index.ipynb).
